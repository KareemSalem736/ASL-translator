// This component is a placeholder for the Profile modal.
// It currently does not implement any functionality or state management.
// You can add state management, form handling, and other features as needed.
// For example, you might want to fetch user data and display it here.
// You can also add a close handler to the modal.
// For now, it simply returns a modal with static content.
// Note: The onClose function is currently throwing an error, which you may want to implement later.
// The modal is set to open false by default, you can change this based on your application state.
// You can also pass props to customize the modal's behavior and content.
